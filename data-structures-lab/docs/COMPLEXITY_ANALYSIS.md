# Time Complexity Analysis

## Chosen Data Structure: Stack 

### Operations Analysis

| Operation | Time Complexity | Explanation |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| push()    | O(1)            | Adding to end of list is instant! |
| pop()     | O(1)            | Removing from end is instant! |
| peek()    | O(1)            | Looking at last item is instant! |
| is_empty()| O(1)            | Checking list length is instant! |
| size()    | O(1)            | Getting list length is instant! |

### Enterprise Web Development Use Case

**Scenario:** Browser Back Button

When you browse websites:
1. push("google.com") → Stack: ["google.com"]
2. push("youtube.com") → Stack: ["google.com", "youtube.com"]
3. push("github.com") → Stack: ["google.com", "youtube.com", "github.com"]
4. pop() → returns "github.com" (go back!) → Stack: ["google.com", "youtube.com"]
5. pop() → returns "youtube.com" (go back again!) → Stack: ["google.com"]

**Why stack is perfect:** 
- Last website visited is first to go back to (LIFO)
- Super fast operations (O(1)) for smooth user experience
- Simple to implement and understand

### Space Complexity
- **Space used:** O(n) - where n is number of items
- **Explanation:** We store each item in a list, so more items = more space

## Reflection Questions

### 1. How does your implementation compare to Python's built-in `list`?
My Stack uses Python's list internally but provides a safer interface specifically for LIFO operations and gives better error messages.

### 2. What trade-offs did you make between simplicity and performance?
I chose maximum performance over memory efficiency. It is simple but uses slightly more memory than a linked list.

### 3. When would you choose your data structure over alternatives?
Choose my Stack for LIFO needs like browser history. Choose other structures for FIFO behavior, random access, or when memory is extremely limited.

### 4. What enterprise scenarios would benefit most?
- E-commerce: shopping cart undo/redo
- Web apps: browser session history  
- Financial systems: transaction processing
- Gaming: action replay systems
